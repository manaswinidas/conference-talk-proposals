# Conference Talk Proposals
This is a place to record all talk proposals submitted to conferences till date.

The objective is to encourage transparency and gauge what a talk proposal looks like and to encourage others to submit talks to conferences. Writing your first talk proposal can be intimidating. Hope this helps!
