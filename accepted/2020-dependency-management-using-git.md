# Conference
Git Commit Show 2020

## Topic
Dependency management using git

### Abstract
It is difficult to manage multiple git projects in an open-source organization. Mostly the projects end up being fragmented and redundant at times, which makes it difficult to maintain. This talk will focus on achieving dependency management for your project using git subtrees and/or git submodules. This talk will be accompanied by a demo of POC achieving the aforementioned for Kogito and how this can aid in multiple applications such as single-sourcing. Major highlights include:

1. Need for dependency management
2. Leveraging git subtrees and submodules to minimize fragmentation and redundancy
3. Subtrees vs submodules(accompanied by demo of POC)
4. Applications and caveats
